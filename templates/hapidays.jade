        h4 <a id="cfp"></a>Want to give a talk?
        p The CFP is the same as the <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/jsfest-oakland-cfp">JSFest call for proposals</a>; please file an issue there and tag your submission with 'hapi'. There is a very small difference, however, as talks will be 10 minutes long and organized into acts that will occur throughout the day.
        p If you would prefer to keep your submission private, feel free to send an email to <a href="mailto:ben@hapijs.com">ben@hapijs.com</a> instead.

        h4 Code of Conduct
        p Please see the <a href="http://oakland.jsfest.com/conduct.html">JSFest Code of Conduct</a> as it applies to hapi days as well.
